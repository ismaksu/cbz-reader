# Simple comic book/manga reader.
A really simple and primitive .cbz reader made without much of thought went into it.
- Why is it so simple and bad?
- : idk, i made it because im bored (oh and also wanted to use JsZip library.)

> Will you develop it further?
- : no. maybe. probably if i get too bored again.

> How can i use it?
- : its up to you. just find a way to download your favorite manga/comic chapter as a cbz file on local, click on index.html and select the file.

> Does it work with non-cbz files too?
- : didn't tested but it might be as long as the content in it is .webp

> Well, you see the code is bad. You should have used this function like this.. and this..
- : honestly you should have probably understood by time you use this, this is not a serious project but i appreciate the effort. fork the project yourself and develop it better publish it i dont care, im ok with it.

> This is not even a big thing to be qualified as a project lmao i could wrote this in 3 minutes.
- : yea thats exactly what i did
